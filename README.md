## About

This project involves developing a web application for a clinic, designed to streamline the management of patient information, appointments, and health insurance. The application is intended for two main user groups: doctors and patients. Doctors will have full access to patient information, including personal data, location, insurance details, and appointments, while patients will be able to view and manage their insurance and appointments. The application will allow users to create, edit, and delete records, thereby improving efficiency and organization within the clinic.
